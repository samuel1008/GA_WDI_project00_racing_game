**Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:**

* **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements?

Your code was solid and the added bonus logic have keeping an ongoing score was awesome.  I would have liked to have seen a more challenging sprite appear on the track.  I see your gifs for player sprites, but they were never implemented.  You had OOP, which was great, but we would have loved to see some methods attached to the Player objects which might have made coding and code flow easier to read and follow.  Some further refactoring to make the code `DRY` would be much appreciated and celebrated.

**meets expectations**


* **Creativity**: Did you add a personal spin or creative element to your project? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

Unfortunately, I cannot give an affirmative assessment for creativity.  I appreciate your code and solution, but the design aesthetics were lacking.

**did not meet expectations**

* **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

Your code was well indented, named, and many best practices were covered. I'd like to see more modularity (extract repeated code into functions) and more comments in your code.

**meets expectations**

* **Problem Solving**: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

Your solution is unique relative to other students' work.  I see your intentions and where you wanted this project to go after further work.  I appreciate your work and your efforts.  I look forward to your refactoring and continued efforts :)
